Mobile Development was one of the courses provided throughout my college years. 

This course was a rollercoaster, where the syllabus was divided into two main parts : Android java development, and Flutter development.
For the Android java, we barely had time to cover the basics of buttons, navigations and simple texts, but for the Flutter part, we got the chance to delve deeper into the 
components development, how widgets work and different UI elements. 
Therefore, a project was required from us where we create an e-commerce application.

The idea behind this project is simple, browsing and buying cars and their accessories. Finding an API for cars was a bit of a challenge, so I opted to have my own data elements.
Although I have gone over APIs and their usages, and even connected a random API to my project to test the functionality of it.

The code might seem huge and patched upon itself, that is due to being mostly a self learn flutter, since in class we barely managed to cover the theoretical parts.
